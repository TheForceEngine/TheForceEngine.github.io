## Getting Started
The current version of The Force Engine does not yet support Outlaws, that it is planned for version 2.0. You will find references to Outlaws in the TFE UI - such as the game data source. However the game is not yet playable.

The first step to using The Force Engine is to purchase and/or install Dark Forces. If you do not own the game, it is currently available at the [GOG](https://www.gog.com/) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) digital storefronts. The Force Engine will attempt to auto-detect your installations, in which case you can get started immediately. However, if this fails for whatever reason, you will need to setup you game data directories manually. To do this, return to the main menu and then select Settings > Game. You will see your current Game Source Data directories, which may be blank. You will need to select the directory that points to the original game's executable or source data - use the Browse button to bring up the file menu. The dialog will tell you which file(s) to select at the top.

Once your game source data is setup, select your Game to play - Dark Forces is the default, and currently only, option. While in the Settings menus, you can adjust Graphics settings such as game resolution and fullscreen/windowed mode, change key bindings and other input settings, adjust sound volume, and various other tweaks. If you have previously saved while playing using TFE, you can also load your saved game. When finished, select Return to go back to the main menu.

## Settings During Gameplay
Once you Start a game, you will be interfacing with the original game's UI. If you want to change settings, such as Graphics, Sound or Control options, or Save or Load a saved game, select the **Config** option in the Escape Menu or use the **Alt + F1** shortcut. This will also allow you to return to the main menu (quitting the game) so you can quickly change mods or in the future, change games. Most Graphics options will change the way the game is displayed immediately, which is a great way of tweaking the settings to your liking while seeing the results.

## Controlling Dark Forces
By default **Alt + F1** brings up the System UI and settings, **Alt + F5** will quick save if possible, and **Alt + F9** will quick load. Note that these bindings can be changed in the Input settings. There is also a console available, the default key is **`** or **~** depending on your region.

In Dark Forces while playing in a mission, by default **Escape** will bring up the menu and **F1** will bring up the PDA. By bringing up the menu and selecting **Config**, you can save or load your game, change settings, or exit the game and return to the main menu. By bringing up the PDA, you get access to the mission briefing, objectives screen, your **inventory** (needed for looking at **keycards** in certain levels, such as the **Dention Center**), your weapon loadout, and the map.

Dark Forces has many controls and options - such as a **headlamp** to see in dark areas, a **gas mask** (once you find the item) to survive in certain areas and more. Check the **Input** menu, under **Settings**, to see all of the possible actions. You can also rebind the actions to different keys and buttons, adjust mouse and controller sensitivity, change the mouse mode - which controls mouselook options, and more.

For example, you might have a directory called `TFE_Install/Mods/Dark Tide 2/` which contains the Dark Tide 2 GOB, LFD and other files.
