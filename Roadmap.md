## Releases
The items listed below represent timeframes for major feature sets. Early on there will likely be many small releases, to fix bugs not caught during testing. However I won't have a feel for the proper release cadance for a while, so any release timeframes are subject to change.

Early releases focus on finishing the core functionality - Outlaws single player, the editors and then multiplayer.
