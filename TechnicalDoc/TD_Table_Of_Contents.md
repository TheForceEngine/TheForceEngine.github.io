# Introduction
This document will describe the structure of the TFE source code, including the game source. This isn't meant to be low level documentation listing functions and variables, except where appropriate, rather a high level overview and a discussion of the features, and systems, and how they relate.

This will discuss topics such as the rendering system in the Jedi Engine and how it is extended to support high resolutions in TFE while keeping the original source intact. Other topics include the Jedi Task System, INF System, player control and physics, collision detection, and more.

It is meant to be a solid overview of the project and source, so that one can begin to understand how the system works and where to begin looking at the code for various topics. This page will act as a table of contents - a quick way to access the specific parts required.
