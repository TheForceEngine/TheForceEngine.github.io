title: Towards Version 1.0
---
With the recent 0.93 release, The Force Engine is now feature-complete for the version 1.0 release. Since then, I have been busy burning through bugs and issues but there is still work to be done. Now that the build seems to be stable and many AI and INF issues have been fixed, I decided to compile a list of bugs and tasks remaining for version 1.0.

I have made these items checkboxes, so that I can update this list as progress is made.

# Version 1.0 Task List

## Polish
- [ ] Add a *portable* option which will cause TFE to store everything (screenshots, settings, saves) in the local TFE directory instead of /Documents/TheForceEngine.
- [ ] Update Readme, Credits, and Manual.
- [ ] Update website (downloads page, media).
- [x] Enable an option to turn off music while menus are active as a work around for music issues, in this case, with real midi hardware.
- [x] Fix the adjustable HUD to use the end caps provided by the community.
- [x] Add a *always try to face the player when attacking* option to Boba Fett. This makes it so he plays a bit closer to how he does with maximum cycles in DosBox. His current behavior is correct, but he appears a bit dumb and easy due to problems with his original AI. This option will greatly improve that and make fighting him much more fun. The work for this is already complete, the task is to make it optional and expose it to the settings and UI.
