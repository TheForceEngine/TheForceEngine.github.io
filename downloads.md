Current Releases are for testing only, the gameplay is incomplete.

### Pre-Release Build Version 0.01.006-1; Win64
[TheForceEngine_0_01_0061.zip](archive/TheForceEngine_0_01_0061.zip) <br>
Changes:
  * "Hot-fix" due to an error in the registry code not verifying the final source data directory.
  * Fixes a "freeze" in "Prelude to Harkov's Defection" when shooting at certain walls.
  * Fixes hardcoded GOG game source data paths for Dark Forces.
  * Fixes Steam game source data paths for Outlaws.
  * Outlaws paths are always filled out now if possible, though only Dark Forces is playable.
  * Now uses the registry to find Steam and GOG game paths, making auto-detecting the game data much more robust - similar to Doom ports like ZDoom and Chocolate Doom.

  * The "Configure" menu option now opens up configuration menus.
  * Game paths can now be set in the application in the "Game" configuration menu.
  * A few graphics settings such as resolution, Fullscreen/windowed can be set in the Graphics menu. "Custom" is available as a resolution choice, which provides additional UI to manually set the desired resolution.
  * About tells you the Build version and provides useful links.
